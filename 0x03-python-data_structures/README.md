- add_0.py
    * it is aux file, which is needed by `0-add.py`. (optional)
- 1-calculation.py
    * Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result.
- calculator_1.py
    * it is aux file, which is needed by `1-calculation.py` (optional)

    * the downloaded file (make sure that your python interpreter version **3.8x** to avoid `bad magic number in 'hidden_4'`)
- 5-variable_load
    * Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.
- variable_load_5
    * it is the aux file, which is needed by `5-variable_load` (optional).
